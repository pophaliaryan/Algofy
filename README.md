# ⚡ Algofy – Prompt-Based Trading Bot Generator

> *From Prompt to Portfolio – Automate Your Trades with Natural Language*

---

## Overview

Algofy is an innovative system designed to **turn natural language trading ideas into executable algorithmic trading bots**. By simply describing a trading strategy in plain English, users can generate Python scripts that represent their trading logic — dramatically lowering the barrier to algorithmic trading.

At its core, Algofy leverages prompt parsing, entity extraction, and dynamic script generation to automate the creation of trading algorithms, making algo trading accessible to traders without programming expertise.

---

## What Algofy Does Today

* **Natural Language Parsing:** Translates simple English prompts into structured trading instructions.
* **Entity Extraction:** Identifies key components such as asset, strategy, trade logic, and risk parameters.
* **Script Generation:** Automatically generates Python trading scripts based on extracted data and pre-defined logic templates.
* **LangChain Integration:** Uses LangChain components for modular and scalable prompt handling and processing.

---

## What’s Coming Next

* **Jinja2 Templating:** Integrate dynamic templates to customize trading logic scripts flexibly.
* **Broker API Integration:** Connect generated scripts with live broker APIs for real-time trading execution.
* **Containerized Deployment:** Package bots into Docker containers for isolated, scalable execution environments.
* **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Manage and deploy multiple bots seamlessly on cloud infrastructure.

## Why Algofy?

Algorithmic trading can be complex and technical, often requiring advanced coding skills. Algofy breaks down these barriers by enabling users to:

* Quickly prototype trading strategies without writing code.
* Automate routine trading workflows with natural language commands.
* Scale trading operations via containerized deployments (planned).

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

1. User inputs a natural language prompt, e.g.,
   *“Trade BTC using a breakout strategy with 1.5% stop loss and RSI confirmation.”*

2. Algofy extracts the asset, strategy, risk rules, and trading logic from the prompt.

3. It generates Python code implementing the trading logic.

4. *(Future)* The code will be wrapped in containers and deployed for live trading.

---

## Current Tech Stack

* Python for parsing and code generation
* LangChain for modular prompt handling
* Jinja2 templating (coming soon)
* Docker & Kubernetes (planned)

---

## Project Status

Algofy is actively in development. Core prompt parsing, entity extraction, and Python code generation are complete. Upcoming features include templating, broker API connectivity, and deployment automation.

---

## How to Use

Currently, Algofy supports generating trading scripts from prompts via a LangChain-based Python codebase. Clone the repo and experiment with prompt inputs to see your ideas come to life as code.
